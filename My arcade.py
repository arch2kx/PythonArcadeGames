        the glass shattering on impact. It doesn’t react at first, but then it stops and you see the terror 
        in its eye. It lets out a bone-chilling shriek as its face slowly starts melting away. 
        In seconds, it collapses onto the ground, covering its face, its painful screams evermore louder, 
        till it suddenly stops… It is gone, no trace of its existence remaining, except for the glass 
        shards on the floor.It is finally over, it is gone, no longer lurking in the shadows, stalking you.

        go back to bed, finally at peace, but right as you are about to fall asleep, you hear a faint creak,
        off in the distance.
